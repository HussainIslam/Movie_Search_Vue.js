# Search Movies - Vue.js
------------------------
This is an alternative construct of the movie searching web application that I built some time ago. This is a close replica of another movie searching web application, which was initially created using basic technologies like: HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. This application is built using the Vue.js, JavaScript framework for front-end developement.

### Functionality
This application initially loads the movies currently playing in the theaters. Then the user can search for a movie name in the give search box. This will populate the DOM with any relevant movie information.

### Technologies Used
The technologies that were used to create this application are:
  >> Vue.js
  >> NPM
  >> axios
  >> bootstrap
  >> bootstrap-vue
  >> eslint

### Shortfalls
This application does not address many issues including (yet):
  >> Security checking for input
  >> No fallback if there is not image available for a movie

Please feel free to give your feedback.
